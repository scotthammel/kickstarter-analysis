# A Deeper Dive into Crowdfunded Campaigns 

## Overview of Project
**Analyzing Outcomes Based on Goals (plays) and Outcomes Based on Launch Date (theater)**

### Purpose
**The purpose of this analysis is to help Louise understand different campaigns in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.** 

### Analysis
- Excel functions was the main form of data analysis to help Louise with her crowdfunding campaign. The SUM() fuction was used to to gather totals. The COUNTIFS() fuction was used to determine the percentage rates for successful, failed and cancelled play campaigns. Louise also wanted to take a deeper dive into "Edinburgh" campaigns specifically using the VLOOKUP() function.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
**The graph below displays the Parent Category of "theater" crowdfunded campaigns that were successful, failed or canceled:**

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
- There were a couple challenges discovered during the analysis. First, understanding the correct Excel functions and where to use it. Second, there was difficulty converting the "deadline" and "launched date" into readable format for Louise. This allowed her to view clearly what date the campaign was created and the date it ended. This analysis will give Louse a better understanding of the average successful campaign length.

## Results

- Based on an analysis of the Theater Outcomes by launch date there are two big conclusions. First, out of 1,369 campaigns, around 61% were successful. Campaigns taken place during the months of May, June and July totaled around 35% of all successful theater campaigns.

-Crowdfunded campaigns in theater or plays were two of the biggest categories based on the dataset. When diving deeper into the Category Statistics sheet, you can see that successful theater campaigns were almost double than the next category: music. Analyzing the Outcomes based on Goals graph will show that the higgest overall avaerage successful campaigns had a crowfunding goal of $1,000-$5,000. Overall, the good news is that the plays crowfunded campaigns were had a high percentage for success if they kept the goal around $5,000 that led to a 72-76% rate. I want to also mention that there are other factors that could be contributing to the success of these campaigns as well that is not shown in the dataset. My advise is to keep the campign goal no higher that range. Limitations are based on relaying on the dataset provided to give Louise the best recommendation. Another possible graph that can be included would be the comparisions other categories based on their launch date and crowfunding goals in comparison to the "music" category.
